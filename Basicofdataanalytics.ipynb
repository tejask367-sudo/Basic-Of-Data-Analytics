        "1. Define the role of a Data Analyst in your own words. What value do they bring to an organization?\n",
        "  - A Data Analyst is someone who turns raw data into clear, useful information that helps people make better decisions. They collect, clean, and analyze data, then interpret what the numbers mean in a real-world context. Instead of just reporting figures, they explain why something is happening and what can be done about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. List three tools commonly used by Data Analysts and explain what each is mainly used for.\n",
        "     1.Microsoft Excel\n",
        "       Excel is widely used for data cleaning, basic analysis, and quick calculations. Data analysts use it to sort and filter data, create formulas, build pivot tables, and generate simple charts. It’s especially useful for small to medium-sized datasets and fast exploratory analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "     2.SQL (Structured Query Language)\n",
        "       SQL is used to access and manipulate data stored in databases. Data analysts rely on SQL to query large datasets, filter records, join multiple tables, and aggregate data (such as totals or averages). It is essential for retrieving accurate data efficiently from relational databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "     3.Tableau (or Power BI)\n",
        "       Tableau is a data visualization tool used to create interactive dashboards and reports. It helps analysts present insights in a clear and visually engaging way, making complex data easier for stakeholders to understand and explore without technical expertise.\n",
        "\n",

        "4. What is Prompt Engineering, and explain any two types of prompts used in Generative AI?\n",
        "  - Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining the instructions (prompts) given to a generative AI model so that it produces accurate, relevant, and useful outputs. A well-written prompt clearly tells the AI what to do, how to do it, and sometimes the format or style of the response.\n",
        "    1) Zero-Shot Prompt\n",
        "    In a zero-shot prompt, the AI is asked to perform a task without being given any examples. It relies entirely on its existing knowledge to generate an answer.\n",
        "  \n",
        "    2)Few-Shot Prompt\n",
        "    In a few-shot prompt, the user provides a small number of examples to show the AI exactly what kind of response is expected.\n",
